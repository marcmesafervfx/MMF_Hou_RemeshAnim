# MMF_RemeshAnim
This tool will allow you to do a static remesh on an animated and deformed geometry. It has a lot of different options to optimize some processes using compiled blocks and SOP techniques.

The installation for this tool is going to be pretty simple:
- Copy the code that you have in the node.py file and paste it inside a new tool that you can create on your custom shelf.
  - For better understanding, you'll need to create a new shelf. Then, you'll need to right click on top of it and select the new tool option.
  - Once you created it, go to the script tab and paste the code.
- If you want to be able to create the node using the tab key, you'll need to use the context tab from the tool and tick the SOP option.
